What we learned this morning:
  - How to start a project
  - How to do unit testing
  - Learned how to do TDD -- before we were writing the code and then testing
  - Class vs. instance of an object: 
                - Class is the definition
                - Instance of an object is the implementation ("new ClassName()")
  - What are the steps of TDD:
                - Arrange/Setup               - Consultation
                - Act                                                       - Action
                - Assert                                                - Reflection
  - What are the steps in modifying code: (http://reddevnews.com/~/media/ECG/visualstudiomagazine/Images/2007/11/listingsID_148_0711_rdn_tb%20gif.ashx)
                - Red: fail
                - Green: pass
                - Refactor: modifying code; implementation; making it better w/out changing the behavior
- What are constructors:
                - Method that runs during the instantiation of your object (think of it as the intialization)
